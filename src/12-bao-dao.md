# DAO Structure

BAO is governed and run by its community of token holders who are at the center of the BAO universe. This page defines the different roles in the DAO, how they work together and how to be onboarded or offboarded from different roles.

## Galaxies

A galaxy is a team of people serving the community with a common goal. A galaxy can be temporary or permanent and people can be members of multiple galaxies.

There are a number of permanent galaxies already in existence and new ones can be proposed for and created by following the Bao Improvement Proposal process.

Any Galaxy may be shut down, or its members recalled and payment immediately ended by full governance vote.

### Maintainer Galaxy

The maintainer galaxy oversees the project and the other galaxies during the decentralization process. As the organization matures and decentralizes more, the power of the maintainer galaxy is reduced to the minimum required to sufficiently fulfill its role. 

The Maintainer Galaxy has the authority to remove contract permissions, treasury permissions, multisig permissions or repository permissions from any Galaxy member that is violating the agreement of the DAO or their position, or who is believed to be a security threat. But that will not halt the budget payments to that Galaxy.

To halt payments that were approved in an annual budget, it must be done by public vote.

This ensures that the Maintainer Galaxy has the authority to act quickly in protecting the protocol from a security threat, but does not have the right to ‘fire’ anyone. It removes the ability for this system to be a hierarchy that does not involve public vote. If the maintainer wanted to remove anyone from their role, it must be done so with a vote that gets majority public approval, for example as part of their annual agenda.

This payment clause will only apply to a Galaxy’s annual funding proposal that was approved by the Treasury, and would not apply to temporary Galaxies or funding that was provided to a Galaxy for a specific project.

Both temporary Galaxies and project-based funding have specific goals to hit and funding can be halted at any time if it fails to hit those goals.
At the end of each year for Bao, the maintainer galaxy need to be reelected and set a forward agenda. An agenda must be then approved for them to continue forward as maintainers. Or else we must vote in other replacements. 

### Community Galaxy
