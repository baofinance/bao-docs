### Implementation

Bao Finance aims to be an open source toolkit that uses existing financial primitives (and perhaps new ones in near future) to build an ecosystem of composable monetary building blocks backed by secure oracles that users can run generalized autonomous financial strategies customized to their own risk tolerance on.
